        Detailed Summary
1. Introduction to Lily Bloom
The novel follows Lily Bloom, a 23-year-old woman who has just moved to Boston to pursue her dream of opening a flower shop. She comes from a troubled past, having grown up in an abusive household where her father physically abused her mother. Despite her difficult childhood, Lily is ambitious and determined to create a better life for herself.

After her father’s funeral, she climbs to the roof of a building to reflect on her emotions, where she meets Ryle Kincaid, a charming and ambitious neurosurgeon. The two share an instant attraction, but Ryle makes it clear that he is not interested in a serious relationship—he only wants casual encounters. Despite this, Lily feels drawn to him.

2. Flashbacks to Lily’s Past – Atlas Corrigan
As Lily begins her life in Boston, she revisits her old journals, which contain entries about Atlas Corrigan, a homeless boy she secretly helped when she was a teenager. Atlas was abandoned by his family and had nowhere to go, so Lily provided him with food and shelter in an abandoned house.

Over time, Lily and Atlas developed a deep emotional connection, and she fell in love with him. However, Atlas eventually left to join the military, breaking Lily’s heart. His departure and her father’s abusive behavior shaped Lily’s views on love and relationships.

3. Lily and Ryle’s Relationship
Despite Ryle’s initial reluctance to commit, he and Lily develop a passionate relationship. He eventually changes his mind about avoiding relationships and tells Lily he loves her. They move in together, and for a while, their relationship seems perfect.

However, things take a dark turn when Ryle exhibits violent tendencies. The first incident occurs when he loses his temper and pushes Lily, but he quickly apologizes, and she forgives him. Over time, his abuse escalates, but he always manipulates Lily into staying by expressing regret and showering her with affection.

Lily finds herself trapped in the same cycle of domestic abuse that her mother endured, despite promising herself that she would never tolerate it.

4. The Return of Atlas
One day, Atlas reappears in Lily’s life, now a successful chef with his own restaurant. He immediately notices signs of abuse and urges Lily to leave Ryle. Although she still has feelings for Atlas, she is conflicted about walking away from her marriage.

When Ryle discovers that Lily has been in contact with Atlas, he becomes even more violent. He attacks her brutally, and she realizes she can no longer make excuses for him. After one final act of domestic violence, Lily decides to leave him.

5. Breaking the Cycle
Lily finds the courage to file for divorce, telling Ryle, "It ends with us." She refuses to let her daughter grow up witnessing abuse, just as she did. This decision signifies her breaking free from the cycle of domestic violence that has haunted her family for generations.

In the end, she reconnects with Atlas, leaving the door open for the possibility of a future together.
